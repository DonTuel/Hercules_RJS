<h4 align="left">Notes</h4>

<p>
When you first start the application it will create a new minimal configuration file. Most options will be off or disabled. You should first enter the connection information for your Hercules system, especially the address and port. I chose to use the name of my PC for the address and 3505 for the port.
<br><br>
This is still a work in progress. It has been tested with TK4. It works well enough for my uses.
<br><br>
It has some minimal testing code in for anyone interested in making changes.
<br><br>
There are various improvements that I can think of. I will update this as time permits. But for now ...
